# NewSnake
Android game
My first Android time-killer I made long time ago. I learned Unity basics while doing this project, that's why code is poor-written.
Game description: It's a 2D game, where you play as a snake and trying to catch a food and avoid different obstacle. There are several defferent levels with different obstacle mechanics. Thre is also 4 different boss fights.
